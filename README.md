# Hostel Carlos App

This App was design to fetch a fixed list of hostels, and present them in a list.
By clicking on an item of said list, the user can get access to a little bit more information about a particular hostel, as well as some pictures (if available).


## Technologies used

- Kotlin
- MVVM Architecture
- Some basic unit testing
- RxJava
- Dagger

All function names have self-explanatory names.
Some notes were left in the code where intentions might not be so explicit.
